## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone v1.1: AI-optimized documentation, not traditional prose docs
- Milestone v1.1: Target audience is open source Symfony developers + AI assistants
- Phase structure: Foundation → Core Skill → Advanced Skills → Web Discovery
- Documentation terminology: "Tuuid" is canonical (not "Translation UUID" or "translation-group")
- Decision tree shows field-type routing (not execution sequence) for user alignment
- Priority explanation separate from tree for clarity
- Troubleshooting entries split 5 setup / 5 runtime for balanced coverage
- Product + Category relationship used in minimal example (defers advanced features to later sections)
