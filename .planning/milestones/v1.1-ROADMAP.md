# Milestone v1.1: AI-Ready Documentation

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 6-9
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Transform the TMI Translation Bundle into an AI-friendly open source project by creating comprehensive documentation that enables any LLM assistant to help users implement translations correctly. Starting with enhanced foundation documentation (llms.md improvements), then building task-specific Claude Code Skills for the three core workflows (setup, debugging, extensibility), and finishing with web discovery via llms.txt. Every requirement delivers observable value for AI-assisted development.

## Phases

### Phase 6: Foundation Documentation

**Goal:** AI assistants understand the bundle's handler chain architecture and can guide users through common troubleshooting scenarios
**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase of v1.1)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md - Glossary and handler chain decision tree
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md - Troubleshooting section and minimal working example

**Details:**
- Added Glossary section with 7 canonical terms (Tuuid, translatable entity, handler, handler chain, locale, source entity, target entity)
- Created ASCII decision tree showing complete field-to-handler routing with priorities
- Added "Why Priority Order Matters" explanation section
- Added 10 troubleshooting entries (5 setup mistakes, 5 runtime surprises)
- Created minimal working example with Product entity walkthrough

### Phase 7: Core Implementation Skill

**Goal:** AI assistants can guide users through making any entity translatable with correct interface implementation, trait usage, and attribute configuration
**Depends on:** Phase 6 (foundation documentation must exist)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md - Create entity-translation-setup skill with workflow and templates

**Details:**
- Created entity-translation-setup skill (192 lines)
- Implemented quick mode (defaults) and guided mode (walkthrough) workflows
- Examples-first guidance for SharedAmongstTranslations and EmptyOnTranslate
- Inline relationship handler behavior summary with llms.md reference
- Diff-style code template with user confirmation

### Phase 8: Advanced Skills

**Goal:** AI assistants can diagnose translation issues and guide users through extending the handler chain with custom handlers
**Depends on:** Phase 7 (core skill establishes pattern)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md - Create translation-debugger skill with diagnostic workflow
- [x] 08-02-PLAN.md - Create custom-handler-creator skill with templates

**Details:**
- translation-debugger skill (114 lines) with 4-layer diagnostic workflow
- custom-handler-creator skill (93 lines) with handler/test templates
- Both skills under 200 lines with details in references/ subdirectories
- Priority decision matrix with 10 standard + 10 insertion points
- 7 concrete use case examples for custom handlers

### Phase 9: Web Discovery

**Goal:** AI crawlers and search interfaces can discover the bundle's documentation and index it for AI-assisted searches
**Depends on:** Phase 6 (foundation documentation must be stable)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 09-01-PLAN.md - Create llms.txt with structured navigation and validation

**Details:**
- Created llms.txt at repository root (27 links across 8 sections)
- H1 with project name, benefit-focused blockquote for Symfony developers
- All 3 AI skills discoverable
- GitHub blob URLs for proper rendering
- llmstxt.org specification compliant

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Use 'Tuuid' as canonical term (not 'Translation UUID' or 'translation-group')
- ASCII decision tree shows routing by field type, not execution sequence
- Troubleshooting entries split 5 setup / 5 runtime for balanced coverage
- Skill auto-activates on trigger phrases
- 4-layer diagnostic structure (Entity Config, Attributes, Handler Chain, Runtime)
- Handler priority insertion points at 5-unit intervals (75, 65, 55, etc.)
- 27 links in llms.txt (mid-range of 20-50 target)

**Issues Resolved:**

- AI assistants can now understand handler chain architecture
- Common translation issues have diagnostic paths
- Custom handler creation is guided with templates

**Issues Deferred:**

- Migration skill for converting from other translation bundles (SKILL-04)
- Performance optimization skill for large datasets (SKILL-05)
- CI validation of code examples (AUTO-01)
- Automated llms.txt generation (AUTO-02)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - all gaps resolved during audit.
